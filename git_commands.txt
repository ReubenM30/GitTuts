git add --a                                      -adds all files to staging area
rm -rf.git                                       -removes as git repo
touch error.log                                  -created new file
git commit -a -m "commit message"                -directly commit a tracked file(instead of adding to staging area and then commiting) 
                                                  but if its a new file then you got to add to staging area
git rm first.text                                -deletes the files and stages the change otherwise normal deletion wouldnt stage it
git mv first.text first_renamed.txt              -renames and stages
git rm --cached ignore.txt                       -untrackes a file (incase it was tracked and you dont want it to)  
git restore --staged first.txt                   -unstage






inside .gitignore
/dir/           -ignore the dir folder
static/dir      -ignore the dir folder inside static
